Dorm Check
This is a dirty little utility I wrote to use while surveying network infrastucture over the summer.
The original process was an excel sheet, but it was difficult to navigate.
This program leads the user through the required inputs for company documentation.
The output is an .csv file.
By the time I got to this point, the project was over and I never finished polishing it up (like getting rid of the global fName). It did work well and save me considerable time.
